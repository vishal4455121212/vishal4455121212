I have about 10 years + of experience in the field of law working as The Best advocate, Social worker and working for national and international clients.

I have completed my master’s in the field of law from Kurukshetra University. I have won awards in several prestigious competitions my early schooling was at D.A.V Public School, Delhi.

When I am not working, I spend my time fulfilling and relaxing pursuits such as reading, painting, and hiking. scuba diving

I enjoy connecting with people throughout the world so that I can use my legal knowledge to fight against injustice, wrong help people and get “JUSTICE“ delivered for them. I am also acting as an advocate for clients in India and as a legal advisor abroad. I have knowledge of Indian laws and the laws of the United States of America. I also helped many clients to fight against ACS. So send me a quick email and we can take it from there.
